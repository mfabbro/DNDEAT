  Description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A tool to help speed up DND combat overhead by maintaining 
character order, HP and notes. Additionally, characters and 
encounters can be saved/edited/loaded at any time allowing the DM 
to modify the encounter even after combat has commenced.

Please contact me on GitHub if there are any bugs that need to be 
fixed. This project was a procrastination task and is bound to have
some.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  User Guide:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
run 'ruby dndeat.rb'

All save files are maintained in a directory called 'saves' 
which resides in the same location as the dndeat.rb file.

-  <enter> is used to confirm all input
-  All menus that are enumerated require the number to be used as the 
   selection key.
-  Most fields can be left blank, however, certain fields won't allow
   the programme to continue until they have been filled with datum.
-  All fields have a type requirement. If alphanumeric values are
   used for a numeric field the programme won't proceed.
-  Input fields have history and this can be accessed using the
   up/down-arrow keys. This is mostly useful when the user 
   accidentally chooses to modify a character's attribute, the history
   will always contain the last value stored for that attribute.
-  If you want to see the full details for any character just use
   'Edit Character' at any time. 
-  Most menus will escape back to their previous location if <enter> is
   pressed and no selection key chosen.
-  Try to keep character names unique. The programme will march on
   if there are duplicates (this tends to happen when merging 
   similar encounter saves), but, when you edit a character who has
   a name shared by others, all character who share this name will
   go through the editing menu, one by one.

  Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Only requires ruby and the yaml library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  TODO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Allow the user to specify what attributes are shown in the combat
  and encounter tables.
- Allow the user to add/remove character attributes. This 
  would allow the programme to be used for other RPGs.
- Implement display.rb using sinatra or other library to allow 
  remote interaction through a web-browser with a friendier 
  UI.
